# BackButtonWithAlias

Sample project to demonstrate how to enhance the existing "back" navigation from the library to include an alias from the screen/panel as well.  When navigating to a new screen, the NetLogic will include the node ID of the alias in the stack with the screen/panel ID.  When navigating back the alias ID will be used.
